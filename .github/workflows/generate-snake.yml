// This workflow generates a snake animation based on the GitHub contributions of the user "wahyu120599".
// It runs daily at midnight UTC and can also be triggered manually.
// The generated snake animation is pushed to the "output" branch of the repository.
// The snake animation is generated using the Platane/snk action, which creates SVG files for both light and dark themes.
